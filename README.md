Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client was a company that wanted to grow their game and allow it to work on multiple platforms. They wanted a server that they could run this game on and needed help in finding a way to get this game to work on multiple platforms.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
One thing I feel like I did well was simplifying complex topics so people who are not as tech sound can read and understand the bigger picture.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The design document really allows you to picture the final product in a wider range than what you could with just writing code. I feel that I was able to get a better understanding of what code I should write while woprking on a design document.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
One thing that I feel needs some work would be my Recommendations section of this document. I feel that parts of it seem to be just wandering thought. They need a bit more structure to them.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
One way I was able to interpret the user's needs was by putting myself in their shoes. I have played many web based games before and I have a feel on what makes a game good. Its important to consider the user because they are ultimatly what makes or breaks a company. They are what supports a buisness.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
One thing I believe I will be using more now will be the UML diagrams. They made looking at and designing software easy for this project.
